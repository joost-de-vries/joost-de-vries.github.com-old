			<h2>Points of view</h2>
			<p>There are so many ways of looking at software development. Here are some of my points of view and beliefs.</p>
		</header>
		<ul class="features">
			<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
				<h3>Functional programming</h3>
				<p>With functional programming applications are <em>easier</em> to understand. Really. <span class="icon far fa-smile" /></p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-laptop">
				<h3>JVM</h3>
				<p>The JVM is an amazing cloud platform for running applications. And the biggest <em>ecosystem</em> of libraries.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-code">
				<h3>Modern programming languages</h3>
				<p>Type inferencing, nullable union types, pattern matching, extension methods. There's a better way of programming and you can use it right now in Scala, Kotlin and Typescript and be really productive.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-headphones">
				<h3>Collective learning</h3>
				<p>By talking to colleagues, keeping up with blogs and twitter and github you can learn what other people learned from hard lived experience. Without the hard lived.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
				<h3>Seeing <em>through</em> microservices, application landscapes and business processes</h3>
				<p>Programming code isn't the goal in itself. Nor are API's, microservices, servers. There's a way of not losing yourself in the technical details and seeing through the <em>matrix</em>. Seeing the bigger functional picture.</p>
			</li>

				<h3>Sol Iustitiae Illustra Nos</h3>
				<p>Because no website is complete without a bit of Lorem Ipsum Latin verbiage. Also, <em><a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/utrecht-university-hall/about-the-university-hall/history">Alma Mater</a>. I studied at Utrecht University.</em>.</p>
